// UnsetValue represents a value used in a query binding that will be ignored by Cassandra.
//
// By setting a field to the unset value Cassandra will ignore the write completely.
// The main advantage is the ability to keep the same prepared statement even when you don't
// want to update some fields, where before you needed to make another prepared statement.
//
// UnsetValue is only available when using the version 4 of the protocol.
